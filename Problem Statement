Road accidents remain a leading cause of fatalities and injuries worldwide, often due to poor awareness of accident-prone areas and delayed emergency response. 
Many existing navigation apps focus on traffic congestion rather than road safety, leaving users vulnerable to high-risk zones. 
Additionally, emergency response times are often slow due to a lack of real-time location sharing and integration with local responders. 
ZeroCrash aims to bridge this gap by providing real-time accident hotspot alerts and a seamless emergency response system, ensuring safer navigation and faster assistance in case of accidents.
